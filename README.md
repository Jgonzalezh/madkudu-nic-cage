Hi Sam, 

We sorry for the inconvenience, this is a major issue for us, and we worked to solve it ASAP.
This is what happened:
Yesterday our AI scoring algorithm went down because the server where it runs, in Amazon Web Services, also went down. Sadly, this means we breached our threshold of 2,8 hours to deliver the score for the customer. 
We have reset the server in AWS to fix the problem. All future leads should be scored correctly. 
For the leads that come in since 7 am this morning, we get our backup to re-run them manually and give the missing scores to the latest leads between 7 am and now. This should be done in 1 hour on your platforms. 
We will also review the amount of lead per unit of time that we are having and check if the server capacity is enough, so we will prevent any problems in the future.
 
Is there anything else I may do for you? 

Sincerely, 
Joaqu√≠n G.

INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - DAY

We see JOHN DOE (played by Nicolas Cage), a middle-aged man sitting on his couch, staring at a photo album. He looks lost in thought.

JOHN: (to himself) I never knew my family had so many secrets.

Suddenly, there is a knock at the door. It's JANE (played by a talented actress), a woman in her 30s, with long blonde hair and piercing green eyes. She is John's girlfriend.

JANE: Hey, I'm home!

JOHN: (excitedly) Hey, I was just looking at this old photo album. I found it in the attic of my parents' house.

JANE: (curious) Oh, really? What's in it?

JOHN: (hesitantly) Well, it's stuff from my family's past. Stuff I never knew about.

JANE: (encouragingly) Tell me more.

John hesitates, then begins to show Jane the photos and tell her the stories behind them. As he does, we see flashbacks of John's family, including his parents and grandparents.

JOHN: (voiceover) My family has always been a little... mysterious. My parents never talked about their past, and my grandparents were always tight-lipped about their experiences during the war.

JANE: (intrigued) The war? Which war?

JOHN: (hesitantly) World War II. My grandfather was a soldier, and my grandmother was a nurse. They met in Europe, and they fell in love. But they never talked about it.

JANE: (gently) Why do you think that is?

JOHN: (sighing) I don't know. Maybe they were trying to protect us from the pain of their past. But
